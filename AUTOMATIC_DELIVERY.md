# Automatic WhatsApp Messaging & Delivery Bucket

## Overview

The system now automatically sends WhatsApp messages when orders complete all stages and provides a comprehensive delivery management system with delivery buckets.

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. Automatic WhatsApp Messaging

When an order completes all stages (reaches "Delivery" status), the system automatically:

- âœ… **Shows success notification**: "Order [ORDER_ID] completed! WhatsApp message will be sent automatically."
- âœ… **Opens WhatsApp**: Automatically opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message
- âœ… **Default message**: Uses a professional template with order details
- âœ… **Customer phone**: Uses the customer's phone number from the database

**Default WhatsApp Message Template:**
```
Hello [Customer Name]!

Your order [Order ID] ([Material Type]) is ready for delivery.
Thank you for choosing Shri Devi Tailoring!
```

### 2. Delivery Bucket System

A new "Delivery Management" section in the Status page provides:

#### **Ready for Delivery Bucket** ðŸŸ¡
- Shows orders that have completed all stages but are not yet delivered
- Displays order details: Order ID, Customer Name, Material Type, Order Type, Due Date
- **"Send WA" button**: Quick WhatsApp message sending for each order
- **Count indicator**: Shows number of orders ready for delivery

- Shows all orders marked as delivered
- Displays recent delivered orders (up to 10, with "+X more" indicator)
- **"âœ“ Delivered" badge**: Clear visual indicator of delivery status
